                    <span class="card-title">How I got into Web Development</span>
                    <p>
                        <em>fyi this is really long im not sure if you want to read it. and no, I did not proofread this.</em><br><br> My intrest in the subject started early in middle school when we first recived each our own laptops. Students quickly figured out many small tricks they could do with them one of them being using developer tools to change texts on websites. This was done until most of the students figured out the trick and everyone becamed bored of it. I however, wondered if I could create my own website instead of editing the sites of others and that was what initialy got me intrested in web development.<br><br> Being a sixth grader who recently discovered the joy of rickrolling, I made a site on a basic Apache deployment with the sole use of redirecting whoever visited it to the infamous song on youtube after a few seconds. I was happy with my creation for a while and soon forgot about it for the rest of the year. It was not until the summer of that year did I again work with Html.<br><br> During my summer, my family and I went to Taiwan to visit some relatives and while we were there, Me and my parents went on back to back trips to various cities and they quickly tired out. I stil wanted to travel but was too young to do so myself so I had to find something to do. Normaly, I would have watched Youtube videos to pass the time but my room had a spotty celular connection and I didnt feel like watching 240p video. I searched through my computer to see if I had any cartoons downloaded and found a copy of the files I uploaded to my server. I thought to myself that I could probably do more with site. In my middle school, we had a diffrent schedule for each day of the week and I wanted a quick way to check at what times classes would start and end instead of carrying around the school-provided paper schedule. I proceeded to make a website with a image containing the schedules for each week and when I got back, uploaded it to the site. It turns out noone but me really used it. I mantained the site up to early 2017 and eventualy decided that I needed a new site.<br><br> That summer, I started to work on the third version of my site which I think looks much better. I ditched the early internet look and went for a more modern one. I also remade the simple rickroll page and left it since at this time even though I was seriously trying to study web deveopment, I was on vacation and didnt get very far since I had other things to do. <br><br> Starting my high school as a freshman, I joined the operations of my robotics club and quickly realised how much I had to learn. (Im not going into detail because theres too much and put simpily, node.js). I was inspired by my talented upperclassmen who were seriously talented and what someone could call a qualified full stack developer. I was envious wanted to help them so I joined them during the robotics training session. We didnt get very far since he ended up being very buissy with his own projects and fixing some high urgency bugs and I was left to study myself. Early on in that same year, I updated my schedule and made some tables for each day of the week but then found that they, the same people in the robotics club, had already made one that far surpasses mine in function and features. Thier platform also already had a large user base and it would be hard to get people to use mine. Because of that, I wanted to join their organisation which they called HarkerDev. I applied but was denied due to lack of experince and I decided to take this class to see if I can take awway something beneficial to me and I want to (after taking this class and spending some time with node.js on my own) reapply to thier organisation next spring.
